# Tic Tac Toe

## Intro

This was me going through the tutorial for [Tic-Tac-Toe in React](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

## Setup Steps

- You will need [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to run this repository. You will also need to add the Dev Containers Extension (ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) to your VS Code plugins. The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to compile React.
- Open the folder in VS Code. Then click `Command (CTRL) + P`. Type in `"> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"`.
- Once the container loads up, open a terminal and type `npm install`.
- Once the package dependencies finish, type `npm run dev` to serve the app.
- Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) to view the app.
